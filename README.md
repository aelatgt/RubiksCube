An A-Frame Project containing a rotating Rubik's Cube.      Under-development by Yukun Song

Download the file zip and open the index.html, then you could see it.

This project now contains large amount of code from Yang Yi so I added the License here. 
I'll fix that into an interactable Rubik's Cube later.
